Input: a, b positive integers
Output: g and d such that g is odd and gcd(a, b) = g × 2d
    d := 0
    while a and b are both even
        a := a/2
        b := b/2
        d := d + 1
    while a ≠ b
        if a is even then a := a/2
        else if b is even then b := b/2
        else if a > b then a := (a – b)/2
        else b := (b – a)/2
    g := a
    output g, d
